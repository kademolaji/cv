# Kayode Emmanuel Ademolaji

#### `Full Stack Developer`

## Summary
Loves Internet and `<coding>`. A strong believer in quality and in the fact that `programming has no language`. I have a `unique passion for building something from nothing`, and nurturing the growth process of a person, team, or system. Similar to how a new mother enjoys watching their first child grow - I enjoy spending my time learning and nurturing new skillset. I love being part of dynamic winning teams, leveraging my `experience in software development`, having actively participated in multiple simultaneous software development projects from `project initiation through final deployment`. 

## Experience Summary
- #### Team Management:   
    I have effectively managed team members in line with company policy and procedures, including performance, development, disciplinary and conflict resolution with effective feedback. I have proactive knowledge about each member of my team, their strengths, weaknesses and effectiveness, whilst translating each of their behaviours into clear tasks and objectives to improve their individual performance. I ensure that all software developed within my team satisfies the business requirements as specified. I give prompt report and updates to all parties involved in a project so that they are well informed of the current stage of the project. 
- #### Software Design Principles:   
    While working on a project, my main goal is to make it work as it supposed to and fulfill all the customerâ€™s requirements. But I believe that creating a project that works is not enough, it should be maintainable and readable as well. I ensure that development standards, policies and procedures are strictly adhered to.  I believe that the most important part of applying design patterns to my codebase is knowing when and where to apply each pattern. I give careful consideration while implementing SOLID principles to only where needed so as to have clean codebase. I apply DRY principle to my codebase. 
- #### Optimization and Scaling: 
    I believe that performance optimization is key in having an efficiently functional application. I have demonstrated strong knowledge of tweaking and stream lining applications for improved performance. Whether a system is scalable or not depends on the architecture. I have built highly performant scalable application using Microservice Architecture, modularization, asynchronous programming and lazy-loading. I have strong knowledge of containerized application using Docker and Kubernetes. 
- #### Security:   
    Implemented system security using JWT, system authorization and authentication defining claims and user roles and activities. 
Continuous Integration/Delivery: 
I have worked with continuous integration and continuous delivery tools such as Jenkins, Octopus, TeamCity, Azure DevOps, JIRA etc. 
Test Driven Development: 
I write unit and integrated test with at least 80% code coverage  
- #### Programming Language and Frameworks: 
    C#, ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, T-SQL, Angular, Html5, CSS3, JavaScript, Typescript, React Native, Bootstrap, Entity Framework, Nhibernate, Dapper etc. 
- #### Database Technology Stack: 
    MS SQL Server, Postgresql, Sqlite, MySql
