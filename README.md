# Kayode Emmanuel Ademolaji

#### `Full Stack Developer`

## Summary
Loves Internet and `<coding>`. A strong believer in quality and in the fact that programming has no language. I have a <`unique passion for building something from nothing>`, and nurturing the growth process of a person, team, or system. Similar to how a new mother enjoys watching their first child grow - I enjoy spending my time learning and nurturing new skillset. I love being part of dynamic winning teams, leveraging my `<experience in software development>`, having actively participated in multiple simultaneous software development projects from `<project initiation through final deployment>`.
